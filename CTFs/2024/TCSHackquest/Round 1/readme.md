# TCS Hackquest Season 8 
## Round 1 Challenges 


## Textual Trailblaze
- You have been assigned the task of conducting a Vulnerability Assessment for a network. A file containing a list of over 5000 IP addresses has been provided. This list includes a mix of valid IP addresses, invalidly formatted IP addresses, IPv6 addresses, short-hand IPv6 notations, and even some with evasive gibberish data.

Your mission is to identify and flag the malicious IP addresses falling into two below specific categories:

IPv4 addresses starting with "99.8." - These have been identified as IPs of threat actors.
IPv6 addresses that match the pattern "2610:a1:*:*:*" - These have been identified as IPs of C2 servers.

After identifying these IP addresses, your next task is to capture the last character of each IP address in their original order of appearance in the file. These characters will be used to form the Flag in the following example format: HQ8{IP_characters}.
